<h3>voice (12:35~)</h3>
<p>I worked as a director</p>
    <p>『voice』is one of the fashion group in "ism." The theme of 『voice』aimed to describe freedom and energy in fashion style.
      『voice』 consists of three sections, I directed the third part,『ruler×mods style(15:57~)』.
    <br>I focused on the meaning which is included in fashion style, mixed "young, freedom, energy" and "ruler" which is reminiscent of being bound by rule.</p>
    At the last part of『voice』(17:30~), we describe "revolution" in order to show the direction of our fashion group.
    <h3>ism</h3>
    <p>『ism』is a theme of CBA project 2017. Following the idea which is a fashion style coming from objects, we combine object with an existing fashion style and develop our new fashion with our unique idea.</p>
    <h3>CBA project</h3>
    <p>“The CBA project” is the group of creating a fashion entertainment show at the school festival. We create a fashion entertainment show from “zero.” It means we create costumes as well as stage, movie, music, and publication. I made a video, designed stage and did a direction. Director creates a concept and direct works. I had been very influenced by and studied by this group.
