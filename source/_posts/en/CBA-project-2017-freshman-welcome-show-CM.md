<h3>CBA project</h3>
<p>“The CBA project” is the group of creating a fashion entertainment show at the school festival. We create a fashion entertainment show from “zero.” It means we create costumes as well as stage, movie, music, and publication. I made a video, designed stage and did a direction. Director creates a concept and direct works. I had been very influenced by and studied by this group.
