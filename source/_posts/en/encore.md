where: 『encore』CBA project 2017
---
 <p>worked as a chief director</p>
<p>“encore” is a theme of the CBA project 2017. Considering the feature and background of a certain fashion style that was popular in the past, we develop those as a new future fashion style and try to interpret in the context of the future. This fashion entertainment show consists of some parts and each part had a director. I talked with them and direct whole show as a chief director.

<h3>Explosion (16:30~)</h3>
<p>worked as a director</p>
<p>『Explosion』is the last section of『encore』. I directed this section to imagine the farthest future.  The concept is an explosion of emotion. The story is that smoldering emotion awake something and is stimulated, then explode. I describe this story inspired by two fashion styles. Those are “Mods” and “Tacky” style. Mods style is the image of smoldering emotion. Tacky style is the image of the explosion.

<h3>CBA project</h3>
<p>“The CBA project” is the group of creating a fashion entertainment show at the school festival. We create a fashion entertainment show from “zero.” It means we create costumes as well as stage, movie, music, and publication. I made a video, designed stage and did a direction. Director creates a concept and direct works. I had been very influenced by and studied by this group.
