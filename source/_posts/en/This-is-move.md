<p>The emotion moves.<br>
        The body moves.<br>
        The situation changes.<br>
        Then you are inspired and move again.<br>
        This is the story of a dress with sound and video.</p>
    <h3>This is move.</h3>
    <p>This is a co-work project. I did all of direction, designing stage and making a some piece of video. I created a story of purification. The transition of emotion of a dress is projected on the screen and dress. I described caught emotion becomes releasing as the story proceed.
    <br>I direct it to be able to convey the drama and use expression that cannot express ordinary video piece.</p>
    <h3>CBA project</h3>
    <p>“The CBA project” is the group of creating a fashion entertainment show at the school festival. We create a fashion entertainment show from “zero.” It means we create costumes as well as stage, movie, music, and publication. I made a video, designed stage and did a direction. Director creates a concept and direct works. I had been very influenced by and studied by this group.
