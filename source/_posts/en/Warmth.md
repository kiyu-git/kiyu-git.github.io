This is a butter knife that was made to fit the hand. Looking down from above, this shape is drawing a curve to be able to grab and use it easily. This design has warmth and good user preference which don't be had by an ordinary metal knife.
### Human and Nature
<p>When I overview five pieces which were created from October 2017 to January 2018, I found all of those pieces were created following the same theme, "the relationship between mankind and nature.
  The first piece, "touch", describes the interest in natural material. The second piece, "lesson", describes the warmth of the tool.
  The third piece, "nature" describes the comparison between nature and man-made. The fourth piece "various aspects of me", describes the way of expression of me. Then, the last piece "coexist and harmony" describes the power of mankind who harmonize man-made with nature.</p>
