This work is a conceptual net art whose theme is the "silence" and published on the Internet.
This work can be enjoyed by devices that can connect the Internet such as computers and smartphones.

### Commentary
The theme of this work is what is the "silence." In the work, the silence and noise, and also black screen and white screen that correspond to each one are irregularly repeated.
When the sound is suddenly stopped or produced, we can notice the sound existing there. For example, when an air conditioner is stopped, we can notice the sound of the air conditioner and there is/was the sound. Many people would have this kind of perception of a sound.
This work reminds us to think about the meaning that there is a sound or not to represent that kind of perception of a sound that exists/ existed there and the screens which correspond to the sounds.
