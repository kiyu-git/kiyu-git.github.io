“Personality consists of two aspects. One is what we can select, the other is what we cannot. However the society requires us to recognize it as good thing regardless of our intention.”

Social Selection means phenomena that social conditions influence on human lifespan, birth rate, and so on. In this work, I grasp this concept wider, focused on “personality.” The appreciators re-experienced the process by engaging this work.
