Look the world through holes.
Ah, human are beautiful.

### Commentary
This work consists of three peep boxes. The author expresses a "sparkle" of the mental world. Each of the peep boxes is named "pray or entrance," "memory," "dialogue." Those three are supposed to watch in order. In "pray or entrance," a tiny light that looks dark unless you look closely. In "memory," multiple bright lights make as if abstract painting in the box. In "dialogue," Your eye is illuminated and reflected on a wall in the box.
Through those works and a caption, the author encourages observers to consider the aesthetics of the mental. And, he claims the mental world of the human is beautiful.

### mute
mute exhibits our work with "minimal and analog aesthetics as theme.

The main theme of our group, mute, is "minimal and analog aesthetics", we decided this theme based on questions which we found in our school.
To think about making something, we have to think about what we want to express and how we can do it. "What" would be various depend on persons, on the other hand when it comes to "how," it seems to rely on audiovisual based on the TV monitor. We have a doubt on that point, so we used "analog" in our main theme. We challenge a new expression through creating physical, sculptural and experiencing works beyond the TV monitor. On the other hand, to think the content of our works, it tends to contain a lot of information and it causes the theme of the work are blurred. We set up "minimal" as one of our themes and are trying to express aesthetics by considering a lot and creating works consisted of minimal elements.
We set up a sub-theme each exhibition, creates works including it and "minimal and analog aesthetics."
