<p>The train is running on the waterside of a beautiful city. The story starts at nightfall in a quiet city. Then, the train comes to the platform. And it goes to the entertainment city in which the spot-light-drones float and illuminate colorfully the city. This city is alive, gorgeous and the admiration of everyone.
<br>This is a short trip for a magical dreamy city.
