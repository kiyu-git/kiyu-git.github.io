Gait Training

*We become accustomed to being in a new place. After more than half a year, our daily life, which was full of discoveries when we first moved here, becomes a routine. We are unconsciously acclimating ourselves to the place. But, in the fluctuations of the seasons and the changes brought by transfer, we think back to the place and realize that we have become accustomed to.*

《Gait Training》 is a project to deliver letters by having people print out daily posts to Twitter. I hope you will follow the link below to all the posts and print out the letters.
