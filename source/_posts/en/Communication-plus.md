This is an interactive piece that uses both ambisonic 3D audio and web VR. The audience watched VR using their smartphone. Before starting, the audience connected it to a web application. Via it, the VR video was played back following the sound proceeding.
In order to enhance the immersion by connecting VR and the real world, cylinders that express the position of the audiences in the real world were shown in VR.  To do so, the audience registered their position on the web application. Also, the color of cylinders changes following the sound proceeding.
A cylinder which is shown at the bottom of the screen presents the position of yourself. The cylinder shown away presents the other audience.
In this video, I used unfolded VR video and binaural sound that was recorded with a dummy head. So, I recommend you to watch this video with a headphone or earphone. In some parts, there are captures of the screen of a smartphone in order to explain easily. 『Communication』 and 『Communication+』 use the same sound but different interaction.
