This is an interactive piece that uses both ambisonic 3D audio and the audienceâ€™s smartphones. Before starting, I had the audience connect a web application. Via it, I made the background color of smartphones change following the sound proceeding. Also, I produced sound from smartphones. By those systems, the audience listened to my piece actively.

In this video, I used a 360 degrees video and a binaural sound which recorded with a dummy head. So I recommend you to watch this with a headphone or earphone to get the feeling of being at a live performance.
