<p>“Ruben’s Tube” is an antique physics device of demonstrating acoustic standing waves. When the sound enters the pipe, the standing wave generates in the pipe. And the pressure of the gas changes places by place. So, an amount of the gas that goes out through the holes change. Therefore, we can watch the shape of the sound wave through the shape of the flame. Now, I'm investigating how I can design a flame form.
<br>We tried to use it with drams.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no record. So, the video is that recorded at experiment</p>
