I made a woodwork display stand using Shopbot for the works that had made through the process: generating data by programming, shaping the data by digital fabrication, and then re-produce the shape by hand in a digital fabrication class.

Each work is produced by shaping by a 3D printer from the data and then reshaping with cray, also shaping by laser cutter from a cross-section of the data and then reshaping by sculpting.

From reconsidering each work that has the process of reference through producing display stand with considering characteristics of both digital fabrication and traditional technique which I have learned before, I sculpted frames from a board as accurately as possible for the works by digital (Shopbot) for hand made works and hand for digital fabricated works.
